## About
In preparation for running new reconstructions, we did a comparison between the reconstruction done in 2015 and those we are using with the tools.

The baseline files are here: `/data/wipac/HEE/simulation/level2/no-domsim/11900/Sunflower_240m/BaseProc/`
The baseline reconstructions are here: `/data/wipac/HEE/simulation/level2/no-domsim/11900/Sunflower_240m/BaseReco/`
The GCD file is: `/data/wipac/HEE/geometries/Sunflower/IceCubeHEX_Sunflower_240m_v3_ExtendedDepthRange.GCD.i3.bz2`
